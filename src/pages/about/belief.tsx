            The United Church&nbsp;of&nbsp;Christ Statement&nbsp;of&nbsp;Faith
          </h2>
          <p>
            We believe in God, the Eternal Spirit, who is made known to us in
            Jesus our brother, and to whose deeds we testify:
          </p>
          <p>
            God calls the worlds into being, creates humankind in the divine
            image, and sets before us the ways of life and death.
          </p>
          <p>
            God seeks in holy love to save all people from aimlessness and sin.
          </p>
          <p>
            God judges all humanity and all nations by that will of
            righteousness declared through prophets and apostles.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Jesus Christ, the man of Nazareth, our crucified and risen Lord,
            God has come to us and shared our common lot, conquering sin and
            death and reconciling the whole creation to its Creator.
          </p>
          <p>
            God bestows upon us the Holy Spirit, creating and renewing the
            church of Jesus Christ, binding in covenant faithful people of all
            ages, tongues, and races.
          </p>
          <p>
            God calls us into the church to accept the cost and joy of
            discipleship, to be servants in the service of the whole human
            family, to proclaim the gospel to all the world and resist the
            powers of evil, to share in Christâ€™s baptism and eat at his table,
            to join him in his passion and victory.
          </p>
          <p>
            God promises to all who trust in the gospel forgiveness of sins and
            fullness of grace, courage in the struggle for justice and peace,
            the presence of the Holy Spirit in trial and rejoicing, and eternal
            life in that kingdom which has no end.
          </p>
          <p>Blessing and honor, glory and power be unto God.</p>
          <p>Amen.</p>
